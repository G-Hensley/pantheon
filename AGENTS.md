# Pantheon

A desktop cockpit for running several AI coding agents side by side, coordinated
rather than siloed. Each agent gets a live terminal pane; panes can share a
context store, and one can be promoted to conductor to fan work out and collect
results.

Windows only: the terminal layer is ConPTY. Status is working prototype, so read
the Known gaps section of `README.md` before relying on any part of it.

This file is orientation. It does not restate the global working-style rules or
the delivery policy, both of which are already loaded from the parent tree.

## Where things are

- `src/` : the React and TypeScript front end, built with Vite.
- `src-tauri/src/` : the Rust side. `mcp.rs` is the in-process MCP server the
  agents talk to, `worktree.rs` is the git worktree isolation, `lib.rs` and
  `main.rs` are the app.
- `ui-gallery/` : component previews.
- `README.md` : what Pantheon is and what it cannot yet do.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` : setup, building, testing, branching, review, and pull
  requests. It is the authority on all of those; do not duplicate it here.
- `BACKLOG.md` : the reasoning behind the open work. Entries record what was
  measured, which hypotheses were refuted, and what was tried and did not work.
  That is the part worth keeping, and it is why it stays prose.

Build with `pnpm`. `dev.cmd` and `build.cmd` wrap the usual commands.

## Tasks

This project's work is tracked in `.tasks/`, one JSON file per task, committed
alongside the code. Read it when you pick work up and update it when you put it
down. A status that no longer matches reality is worse than no status, because
it is the one people trust.

    agent-toolkit task list                    # what is open here
    agent-toolkit task show <id>               # one task, including done_when
    agent-toolkit task set <id> status=doing   # claim it
    agent-toolkit task set <id> status=todo done_when="..."   # several at once
    agent-toolkit task add "Title" --status backlog

Always go through the command rather than editing the JSON. The command holds
the compare-and-swap that stops one agent's write reverting another's, and argv
cannot be malformed the way a hand-written JSON document can.

Reasoning stays in `BACKLOG.md`. A task links to it; it does not swallow it.

## Writing style

No em dashes in authored prose, documentation, or user-facing text. Use a colon,
semicolon, comma, or parentheses. This applies to natural language, not to
hyphens required by code, commands, flags, paths, or identifiers.
