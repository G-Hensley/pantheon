#![cfg(windows)]
//! ConPTY delivery measurement, for investigating the dispatch truncation.
//!
//! **Ignored by default, and run deliberately:**
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --test pty_truncation -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! These are a measurement harness, not regression tests. They open a real
//! ConPTY, write a payload through the same writer `spawn_session` uses, and
//! report what arrives. On a headless CI runner that measurement is not
//! meaningful: there is no console behind the pseudo-console, the child
//! returns nothing, and the harness reports a loss that says more about the
//! runner than about ConPTY. Left un-ignored they were failing every CI run on
//! this repository while passing on a desktop, which is a test that reports
//! the environment rather than the code.
//!
//! `--nocapture` matters: the numbers are the output, and the assertions only
//! guard the conclusion drawn from them.
