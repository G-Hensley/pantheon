// Pantheon — multi-session PTY engine.
//
// Each live agent runs on its own pseudo-terminal (ConPTY). Sessions are keyed
// by a client-supplied id so the frontend can address a pane (write/resize/kill)
// the moment it asks to spawn it, while the streaming command keeps running in
// the background. In later milestones this grows a TOML registry + git-worktree
// isolation; here it's the flat, working core.
